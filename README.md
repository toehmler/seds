# Staged Event Driven Server (SEDS)
This project was born out of curiosity I had for alternative architecture designs patterns when building my own HTTP/1.0 server in C. While doing so I wanted to see ways to minimize thread contention, and came across the paper (Staged Event-Driven Architecture for Highly-Concurrent Server Applications)[https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.437.5195&rep=rep1&type=pdf] and wanted to see if I could implement the pattern myself from scratch. In the process I learned more about network programming with sockets and was introduced to ring-buffers for lock-free producer / consumer queues. I have implemented two separate servers in this project. One uses a more traditional thread pool approach, while the other is my attempt at implemented a SEDA server.
